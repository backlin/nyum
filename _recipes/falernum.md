- 2.4 dl unaged rum (ideally 50 – 65% ABV)
- 40 hela nejlikor
- 1.8 dl tunnt hyvlad mandel

> ### Day 1
> Add cloves and sliced almonds. Stir every 5-10 seconds to ensure both sides of the almonds are toasted. You want the almonds browned to a medium-dark tone without burning them. It took me about 5 minutes but use your best judgment.
>
> Spoon the cloves and almonds into a clean 1-quart mason jar. Add the rum and cover with lid. Let stand overnight, gently agitating every few hours.
>
> Regarding the rum: I’ve used Wray & Nephew Jamaican Overproof in the past. I used 6 oz of Cockspur 130 and 2 oz of Rum Bar Silver this time. Feel free to experiment with the rum(s) you use while keeping the target ABV of 50% – 65% in mind.

- 28 g ingefära
- 2 lime

> ### Day 2
> Thin slice the ginger. I used a vegetable peeler and then switched to a knife when the piece was too small for the peeler.
> 
> Peel two limes, focusing on removing just the outer layer with as little pith as reasonably possible.
> 
> Add ginger and lime to the rum/almond/clove mixture in the mason jar. Stir/agitate with a spoon to fully submerge everything.
> 
> Let sit overnight, agitating every few hours.

- 4.8 dl strösocker
- 2.4 dl vatten

> ### Day 3
> Sterilize a separate quart mason jar. Wetting the inside and 60 seconds in the microwave works well.
> 
> Make cold process simple syrup. Add one cup of water, then two cups of white table sugar. Close with lid and occasionally shake until the sugar is gone and the liquid is clear.
> 
> Now we’re ready to combine the infused rum and rich simple syrup.
> 
> Strain the infused rum into the mason jar containing the simple syrup. I used a fine mesh strainer (chinois) and a funnel. I let the infusion solids fill the strainer basket and gently press with a spatula to squeeze out as much infused rum as possible.
> 
> Cover and shake to combine. Try a small sample and see what you think.
