            <li>300 g cooking apples (such as Bramley), peeled and cut
            into quarters</li>
            <li>500 g ripe plums, halved, stone removed</li>
            <li>450 g fresh blackberries</li>
            <li>200 g caster sugar</li>
            <li>15 g butter</li>
            <li>sunflower oil, for greasing</li>
            <li>10 thick slices white bread, crusts removed</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Place the fruit, sugar and butter into a saucepan and
            cook on a medium heat for 15 minutes, or until softened.
            (Don’t stir too often as the fruit will become mushy.)</p>
            <p>Remove the pan from the heat and pour the contents into a
            colander set over a large bowl. Leave to stand for 8-10
            minutes, stirring once or twice, so as much juice as
            possible is released by the fruit. You should end up with
            around 600ml/20fl oz.</p>
            <p>Pour the fruit juice back into the saucepan, bring to a
            simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the volume of
            the liquid has reduced by half. Remove the pan from the heat
            and set aside to cool for 20-30 minutes.</p>
            <p>Lightly oil a 1.5 litre/2 pint pudding basin and line
            with clingfilm, leaving plenty overhanging the edge. Cut a
            slice of bread using a round cutter and dip it quickly into
            the fruit juice. Place in the base of the pudding basin.</p>
            <p>Cut the other bread slices in half and dip one at a time
            into the juice. Arrange in slightly overlapping vertical
            pieces around the inside of the basin, making sure they are
            soaked in juice without being soggy.</p>
            <p>Once all the sides of the basin are lined with bread,
            pour half of the remaining fruit juice over the drained
            fruit and stir very lightly until it looks plump and glossy.
            Spoon the mixture into the pudding basin.</p>
            <p>Dip the remaining slices of bread in the fruit juice and
            place over the top of the pudding, trimming the bread where
            necessary to give a neat finish. Reserve any remaining fruit
            juice in a small bowl.</p>
            <p>Place the pudding onto a dinner plate. Cover the top of
            the pudding with the cling film, place a plate on top (make
            sure it fits inside the basin) and weigh down with a couple
            of tins. Chill in the fridge overnight.</p>
            <p>When ready to serve, remove the weights and plate and
            open the clingfilm. Place a serving plate on top of the
            pudding and invert. Remove the basin and peel off the cling
            film. Brush any gaps where white bread is showing with the
            reserved fruit juice.</p>
